# Globe - Connected Ethereum Wallet PoC

Globe was meant to be a connected Ethereum Wallet. Most Wallets or Coin Trackers are stupid and don't check the actual balance of the Ethereum or other Coins address on the actual DLT.
This wallet let's you scan Ethereum addresses and save them locally. It gathers the transactions and current amount of holdings directly from the ledger, thereby always beeing up to date.
